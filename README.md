Overview:
The fifth part of a multi-project series, this Java program adds a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the GPS trip data. Using previous project data, it plots the trip points on a map and animates the route, providing an interactive and visual representation of the trip.

In this project, we implement a map GUI using Java, allowing users to view the trip path with an animation feature that tracks the tripâ€™s progression. Users can select animation speed, include or exclude stop points, and view the route as it plays out on the map. This project integrates a mapping library to facilitate visualization.

Features:
1. Interactive Map: Displays GPS coordinates from the trip data on a map, showing the entire trip path.
2. Animation Controls:
  - Animation Speed: Offers options to animate the route over 15, 30, 60, or 90 seconds.
  - Stop Inclusion: Provides a checkbox to toggle display of stops on the route.
  - Play/Reset Button: Begins the animation or resets it to start anew, clearing previous animations from the map.
3. Current Position Tracking: Shows the current trip point with an icon and leaves a trail of the path.|

Required GUI Components:
1. JComboBox: Allows selection of the animation duration.
2. JCheckBox: Toggles inclusion of stops in the route visualization.
3. JButton: Starts or resets the animation, clearing prior tracks if re-played.

Map and Animation Details:
  - Map Centering: Centers the map over the area of the trip for optimal view.
  - Position Tracking: Uses an icon to show the current position on the route.
  - Trail Display: Leaves a line showing the route behind the position icon, highlighting the path taken.

Getting Started:
1. Setup: Clone the repository, import the triplog.csv file from previous projects, and add the required mapping library (e.g., JMapViewer).
2. Run: Start the GUI and use the controls to animate the trip route.
3. Customize Animation: Adjust animation speed and include or exclude stops for varied visualization.
